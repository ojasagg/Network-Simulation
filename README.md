# Network-Simulation
Network simulation.
The goal of this project is to get a first hand experience in doing simple wireless networking research. 
We considered the scenario of a number of clients connected over WiFi to a web server via an access point (AP), and downloading content from the server. 
We also considered a scenario of online quiz conducted in a class. The students downloaded quizzes and reference material. We analyzed and understood wireless network performance in such a scenario, using a combination of simulations and analysis of real traces. 
Our particular emphasis was on understanding how and why WiFi performance degrades when there are a large number of users.
